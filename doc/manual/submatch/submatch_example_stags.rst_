Here is an example of using s-tags to parse a file with IPv4 addresses.
It shows how tags should be handled in the more complex case when ``YYFILL`` is
used: tag variables should be part of the lexer state, shifted like other input
positions by ``YYFILL``. (In the simpler case when buffer refilling is not
needed, tag variables can be defined as local variables.)
